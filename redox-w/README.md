## Redox-W (Wireless)

The Redox-W is the wireless version of the Redox keyboard, it comes in two flavours:

- **Rev 1.0W**: The first revision of the Redox Wireless.
- **Rev 2.0WHS**: Hot-swappable version of the Redox Wireless. It comes with some range improvements and limited compatibility with Rev1.0W cases (more on that in the [dedicated section](#case-compatibility)).

The two hardware revision share the firmware and the receiver dongle. In this page you'll find assembly instructions for both versions of the keyboard.

> :information_source: You can also use the [Mitosis receiver](https://github.com/reversebias/mitosis-hardware/blob/master/bom/README.md) since it's almost identical, or you can build a receiver on your own.

> :warning: To program the YJ-14015 MCUs you need an ST-Link v2 programmer, these can be found on eBay or Aliexpress for as little as 2$ shipped. See [picture below](#nordic-mcus-firmware).

##### Resistor values

If you want to customize your LEDs color or save a few bucks by ordering the LED all the same color you can refer to this section for choosing the correct resistor values. Otherwise you can refer to the [default configuration](#default-configuration).

There are two sets of resistor that you need for the receiver.

- The voltage divider resistors (`R1`, `R2` and `R3`): anything between 1.5k Ohm and 4.7k Ohm is good.
- The LEDs resistors (`R4`,`R6`,`R7` and `R8`): see the following table.

| LED color | Vf   | Suggested resistor value |
|-----------|------|--------------------------|
| Red       | 1.7V | 330 Ohm                  |
| Yellow    | 2.1V | 330 Ohm                  |
| Blue      | 3.2V | 220 Ohm                  |
| Green     | 2.2V | 330 Ohm                  |
| White     | 3.6V | 220 Ohm                  |

Depending on the color you choose to use you should use the resistor listed above.

#### Default configuration

Here you can find the default configuration for the receiver assembly.

| Label | Component         |
|-------|-------------------|
| D1    | Red LED           |
| D2    | Blue LED          |
| D3    | Green LED         |
| D4    | White LED         |
| R4    |  330 Ohm resistor |
| R6    |  220 Ohm resistor |
| R7    |  330 Ohm resistor |
| R8    |  220 Ohm resistor |
| R1    | 1.5k Ohm resistor |
| R2    | 1.5k Ohm resistor |
| R3    | 1.5k Ohm resistor |

## Receiver Assembly

The receiver assembly is pretty straightforward, you can install the components in any order you like with the exception of the YJ-14015: it should be installed **after** the right angled header (PROGR_HEADER1). Suggested assembly order:

1. Solder D1, D2, D3 and D4 LEDs. See [image](#leds-installation-detail) for orientation.
2. Solder R4, R6, R7 and R8 resistors.
3. Solder R1, R2 and R3 resistors.
4. Solder the AMS1117.
5. Solder the Arduino Pro Micro headers.
6. Solder the programming headers. I suggest you to cut the excess of the header **before** soldering the headers. You should stay as flush to the PCB surface as possible since the controller will be soldered above the headers. Use some masking tape to help you keep the header in place while soldering.
7. Solder the YJ-14015. I suggest you to glue it in place or use some masking tape to help you during soldering.
8. Upload the firmware and you're done.

## Transmitters Assembly

### Rev 1.0W transmitters assembly

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/redox-w-pcb1.jpg" alt="Wireless redox PCBs" width="600"/>
</p>

Assembly steps:

- Solder components to PCBs (you can proceed in no particular order):
  1. Solder the YJ-14015.
  2. Solder 1N4148 diodes.
  3. Solder slider switches.
  4. Solder the battery holders. *Note*: Some solder is needed on the ground pad to contact properly with the battery. See [picture below](#battery-holder-installation-detail).
  5. Solder the programming headers.
- Fit the PCBs inside their cases.
- Add the switches to the plate.
- Solder switches to the PCB.
- Add the CR2032 batteries.
- Program the MCUs.

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/redox-w-2.0-transmitters-assembly-1.jpg" alt="Redox 2.0WHS PCBs, unassembled." width="600"/>
</p>

Suggested assembly order (there's no wrong way of doing this because all parts can be soldered in any order):
1. Solder the YJ-14015.
2. Solder the right angle 0.1" header. To test the solder job try uploading the firmware as described in the dedicated section.
3. Solder the diodes taking into account the right orientation. The cathode side (denoted by the vertical line on the packaging) should face the squared hole on the PCB. See the [pictures](#diodes-and-hot-swap-socket-detail) for reference. If you have already assembled the Redox receiver, you can now test if the PCB is working properly by connecting the STLinkV2 debugger for supplying power to the transmitter and using a pair of pliers to short the Kailh socket pins.
4. Solder the Kailh hot-swap sockets.
5. Solder the battery holders.
6. Solder the slide switch.

</p>

[Here](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard/tree/master/redox-w/rev2.0WHS/case) you can find the newly designed case for the Redox 2.0 WHS. Features:
- Easy to print
- Sturdy feeling
- Minimal footprint
- Integrated sound dampening

I printed it with my Prusa Mini with 0.2 mm layer height. The STLs are for the left hand keyboard only, you'll need to mirror them along the X axis in your slicer for the right hand keyboard.

Hardware required for assembly:
- 10x M3 8 mm screws
- 10x M3 nuts

> :warning: The 3D printed case requires the use of SMD diodes. Through hole diodes will interfer witht the front plate.

> :warning: The closed back design (file: `BackplateL.stl`) was not tested at the time of this writing.

## Firmware

**Basics**: The Redox keyboard works similarly to the [Mitosis keyboard](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/mitosis): we have two transmitters responsible for scanning the two matrices, which then transmit the matrix status through the [Gazel protocol](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF5_SDK/nRF51_SDK_v5.x.x/doc/5.2.0/html/a00140.html) to the receiver. The receiver is another YJ-14015 which receives the two matrix scans and send it through serial to the Arduino Pro Micro. The Pro Micro is responsible for running QMK and converting the bytes received by the YJ-14015 into actual keystrokes.

Firmware sources available here: [https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-w-firmware](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-w-firmware).

You'll need to upload the firmware to the corresponding MCUs as per the following diagram:

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/redox-w-firmware-1.png" alt="Redox-W firmware diagram." width="600"/>
</p>

Note that you'll need to upload the firmware for the YJ-14015 only once. Everything related to the keymap is handled by the Arduino Pro Micro and QMK Firmware, that's what you will need to modify to update the keymap.

### Step-by-step firmware upload guide

#### Arduino Pro Micro Firmware upload

Let's start by uploading the QMK firmware on the Arduino, this will help us in diagnosing problems early on. The Redox Wireless uses QMK for its firmware, follow the QMK installation instructions [here](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools), then compile and burn the firmware as follows:

```sh
$ cd path/to/qmk_firmware
$ make redox_w:default:avrdude
```

You can find the code for the Redox here: [QMK - Redox Wireless keyboard](https://github.com/mattdibi/qmk_firmware/tree/redox_wireless/keyboards/redox_w).

In the [Redox Wireless Keyboard firmware repository](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-w-firmware/tree/master/precompiled) I added some pre-built hex files with the default keymap for testing purposes.

#### Nordic MCUs Firmware upload using Docker

To flash the firmware files to the corresponding MCUs, you'll need an STLinkV2 debugger.

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/st-link-v2-programmer.jpg" alt="ST-Link v2 programmer" width="300"/>
</p>

##### Setup

###### Requirements

- Linux-based distro (macOS should work too but wasn't tested)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Download the [redox-w-firmware](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-w-firmware) repository.

###### Download the repository

Open a terminal and download the Redox Wireless firmware repository wherever you want.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-w-firmware.git
```

or

```
$ wget https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-w-firmware/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
```

###### Install the udev rules

Install the udev rules for the STLinkV2 programmer contained inside the repository.

```
$ cd path/to/repository/redox-w-firmare/
$ sudo cp 49-stlinkv2.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
$ udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger
```

Plug in, or replug in the programmer after this.

###### Build the two container images

From inside the `redox-w-firmware` folder run:

```
$ docker-compose build
```

After the process completes you should see three new images:

```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY           TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
redox-fw-toolchain   latest    810de995238e   16 minutes ago   896MB
redox-fw-openocd     latest    173d86d1409c   18 minutes ago   168MB
ubuntu               16.04     8185511cd5ad   4 weeks ago      132MB
```

##### Programming the receiver

###### Hook up the receiver

Hook up the ST-Link debugger to the receiver board you assembled without the Arduino. You need to connect only the `VCC`, `GND`, `SWDIO` and `SWCLK` pins of the receiver board like this:

| ST-Link Debugger | Receiver board |
|------------------|----------------|
|       3.3V       |       VCC      |
|        GND       |       GND      |
|       SWCLK      |      SWCLK     |
|       SWDIO      |      SWDIO     |

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/redox-w-firmware-5.jpg" alt="ST-Link debugger wiring." width="600"/>
</p>

Then plug in the ST-Link debugger into your PC.

###### Run the two images using docker compose

After connecting the STLinkV2 debugger, from inside the `redox-w-firmware` folder run:

```
$ docker-compose up
Creating redox-w-firmware_openocd_1 ... done
Creating redox-w-firmware_toolchain_1 ... done
```

From another terminal window, you should see the two containers running with the following command:

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
84f606ad7e25   redox-fw-toolchain:latest   "tail -f /dev/null"      4 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds             redox-w-firmware_toolchain_1
8d0d6b5da95a   redox-fw-openocd:latest     "/bin/sh -c 'openocd…"   4 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds             redox-w-firmware_openocd_1
```

If everything works you should see the following output in the docker-compose terminal:

```

###### Build and upload the firmware

We can now build and upload the firmware by issuing the following from the `redox-w-firmware` root directory from another terminal window:

```
$ docker exec -it redox-w-firmware_toolchain_1 ./redox-w-firmware/redox-w-receiver-basic/program.sh
```

if everything goes well we should see the following output:

```

###### Shutdown the container and disconnect the programmer

We can now shutdown the containers by issuing a `Ctrl-C` inside the docker-compose terminal. After the command completes we can disconnect the STLinkV2 programmer and proceed to program the rest of the MCUs.

##### Programming the two halves

###### Hook up the transmitter

Hook up the ST-Link programmer with the transmitters using the programming pins, and plug the debugger in you PC.

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/redox-w-firmware-3.jpg" alt="Transmitters programming pins." width="600"/>
</p>

Start a OpenOCD session as seen [above](#run-the-two-images-using-docker-compose) using docker-compose and start flashing the firmware.

###### Left hand firmware flashing

From another terminal window issue the following command:

```
$ docker exec -it redox-w-firmware_toolchain_1 ./redox-w-firmware/redox-w-keyboard-basic/program_left.sh
```

You should see a similar output as above. You can now shutdown the two containers, disconnect the programmer and proceed with the next MCU.

###### Right hand firmware flashing

After having hooked up the right hand to the ST-Link debugger and started a new OpenOCD session we can upload the right hand firmware.

```
$ docker exec -it redox-w-firmware_toolchain_1 ./redox-w-firmware/redox-w-keyboard-basic/program_right.sh
```

Congratulations! You flashed the Redox-W firmware.

## Battery usage

I got the current consumption for the transmitters using a shunt resistor (10 Ohm) and an oscilloscope during transmission.

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/redox-w-battery-usage.jpg" alt="Current draw for Redox-W transmitters" width="600"/>
</p>

Data:
- Current peak of 5mA (I<sub>run</sub>) and 50us duration (t<sub>run</sub>)
- Idle consumption of 2.7uA (I<sub>idle</sub>) between peaks, that is 950us duration (t<sub>idle</sub>).

We can then calculate the average current consumption during typing (I<sub>avg</sub>) using the following:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=I_{avg}&space;=&space;\frac{I_{run}t_{run}&plus;&space;I_{idle}t_{idle}}{t_{run}&plus;t_{idle}}&space;=&space;\frac{5{mA}*50{\mu&space;A}&plus;2.7{\mu&space;A}*950{\mu&space;s}}{1ms}&space;\simeq&space;250&space;\mu&space;A" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?I_{avg}&space;=&space;\frac{I_{run}t_{run}&plus;&space;I_{idle}t_{idle}}{t_{run}&plus;t_{idle}}&space;=&space;\frac{5{mA}*50{\mu&space;s}&plus;2.7{\mu&space;A}*950{\mu&space;s}}{1ms}&space;\simeq&space;250&space;\mu&space;A" title="I_{avg} = \frac{I_{run}t_{run}+ I_{idle}t_{idle}}{t_{run}+t_{idle}} = \frac{5{mA}*50{\mu s}+2.7{\mu A}*950{\mu s}}{1ms} \simeq 250 \mu A" /></a>

Knowing that the CR2032 battery is rated for 220mAh we get:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=t_{batt}&space;=&space;\frac{C_{batt}}{I_{avg}}&space;=&space;\frac{220{mAh}}{250{\mu&space;A}}&space;\simeq&space;880h" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t_{batt}&space;=&space;\frac{C_{batt}}{I_{avg}}&space;=&space;\frac{220{mAh}}{250{\mu&space;A}}&space;\simeq&space;880h" title="t_{batt} = \frac{C_{batt}}{I_{avg}} = \frac{220{mAh}}{250{\mu A}} \simeq 880h" /></a>

**TLDR**: We can expect **at least 880 hours** of continuous typing on the keyboard before needing to change the batteries. Keep in mind that when you're not typing (500ms without key presses is the time interval needed for the keyboard) the transmitters go into deep sleep mode and draw only 2.7uA. So for an everyday use (4 hours a day of continuous typing) you can expect a battery life of at least a year. Obviously your mileage may vary.

> :information_source: After using my keyboard for a few years I can confirm that battery usage matches the above computations. Please note that a metallic case can greatly impact user experience and battery usage.

## Case compatibility

Revision 1.0W and 2.0WHS share a lot of similarities with the exception of a single mounting hole.

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/holes-case-compat.PNG" alt="Redox-W revisions compatibility." width="600"/>
</p>

As you can see from the above image, the mounting hole was moved a little lower in the rev 2.0WHS. This shouldn't compromise usability and fitment but take this into account if you want to fit a 2.0WHS PCB into a 1.0W case or vice-versa.
