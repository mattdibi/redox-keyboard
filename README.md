The Redox project is an open-source, [QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware)](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) powered, ergonomic split mechanical keyboard. This repository will be used to share information about the project and instruction on how to use and assemble the Redox keyboard.

**Designer's bio**: [Mattia Dal Ben (aka u/TiaMaT102)](mailto:matthewdibi@gmail.com) obtained a master's degree in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Computer Science at the University of Udine. Currently works as a Software Engineer in R&D department for a big IoT and Embedded Computers company. Mechanical keyboard enthusiast and maker, the Redox keyboard is the result of all of his passions.

## Rationale

The Redox is a keyboard project designed with ergonomics in mind. It uses Cherry MX style mechanical switches laid out in a 7x5 columnar stagger layout with components that can easily be sourced.

The design was heavily inspired by the [Ergodox keyboard](https://www.ergodox.io/), and its main goal is to reduce the size without sacrificing too many keys, hence the name **Re**duced Ergo**dox**.

As an Ergodox user I couldn't ignore the few flaws of the original design and in a moment of arrogance I tried to fix them, thus the Redox features:
- Easier to reach thumb cluster.
- Additional easy-to-reach rotated 1.25u thumb key.
- Reduced size.
- Reduced costs (the Redox uses Arduino Pro Micro instead of the Teensy 2.0).
- Either half can be plugged in to the PC since each half can act as the master.
- Either half can work as a standalone keyboard to be used as a macropad/gaming keyboard.
- RGB backlighting support.
- 3D-printer friendly case.
- Wireless [see section below](#wireless-implementations)
- [VIA](https://caniusevia.com/) compatible (thanks to [Harshit Goel](https://github.com/harshitgoel96))
- [ZMK firmware](https://zmk.dev/) compatible (thanks to [toddmok](https://github.com/toddmok))
- [KMK firmware](http://kmkfw.io/) compatible

## Wireless Implementations

The Redox keyboard uses three different wireless implementations, differentiated by firmware:
 - *QMK based*: Leveraging the [Gazel protocol](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF5_SDK/nRF51_SDK_v5.x.x/doc/5.2.0/html/a00140.html). It needs its own PCB and a receiver dongle (see [Redox Wireless](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard/tree/master/redox-w) for details) and needs three YJ-14015 MCUs + a Pro Micro compatible controller.
 - *ZMK based*: Leveraging the Bluetooth protocol. It is based on the [Redox wired PCB](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard/tree/master/redox) and the [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/) controller.
 - *KMK based*: Adding [Bluetooth Split](http://kmkfw.io/docs/split_keyboards#bluetooth-split-aka-no-trrs-currently-in-testing) code to `boards/redox/main.py`. Combined with a [compatible](http://kmkfw.io/docs/Officially_Supported_Microcontrollers) wireless controller completes wireless configuration. Would advice adding [Bluetooth keycodes](http://kmkfw.io/docs/keycodes#bluetooth-keys) in keymap; `keyboard.keymap` element in `main.py`.

 The notable differences for the three implementations are as follows:
 - _Battery life_: QMK Redox Wireless uses two CR2032 coin cell batteries which last [approximately one year (YMMV)](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard/tree/master/redox-w#battery-usage), while the nice!nano support LiPo rechargable batteries (you can choose the capacity you want but expect them to last for a [few weeks on a single charge](https://zmk.dev/power-profiler)).
 - _Flexibility_: The receiver dongle limits the flexibility of QMK Redox Wireless.
 - _Cost_: The 3x YJ-14015 + Pro Micro combo is cheaper than two wireless controllers required for ZMK and wireless KMK.
 - _Range_: Bluetooth implementations, of ZMK and KMK, should be more capable than what can be achieved with the QMK Redox Wireless (At this point in time, I lack the evidence to support these claims though).

| 1.25u |  10 | You can get away with 8 if you use two 1u keycaps for the 1.25u rotated keys |
| 1u    |  54 |                                                                              |

> :information_source: On [pimpmykeyboard.com](https://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-1976-keyset-two-shot/) site you can find a SA 1976 keyset kit specifically made for the Redox keyboard: the "Ergo Redox kit (12 keys)".
